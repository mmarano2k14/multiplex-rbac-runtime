## Overview

Deterministic AI Runtime is a .NET runtime for executing complex AI workflows as controlled, observable, recoverable, replayable, and auditable distributed executions.

It is designed for workloads such as:

- LLM orchestration
- RAG pipelines
- tool execution
- decision workflows
- long-running AI processes
- multi-step distributed execution

The runtime treats AI orchestration as a systems problem, not only as a prompt engineering problem.

It provides a state-driven execution layer where:

- workflows are modeled as DAGs
- workers are stateless
- Redis stores hot execution state
- Redis Lua scripts enforce atomic coordination
- MongoDB stores durable payloads and snapshots
- context helpers resolve inputs, payloads, provider metadata, and policy context
- policies control retry, retention, and concurrency
- metrics, traces, and ledger events share runtime correlation
- executions can be replay-validated from persisted snapshots
- execution can be paused, resumed, cancelled, or blocked for human input
- submitted runs can be admitted, assigned, globally queued, dispatched, scale-out requested, rejected, listed, retrieved, or cancelled through the shared runtime controller

The project should be read as an AI execution infrastructure foundation. The runtime core is already substantial, while the longer-term direction is to evolve toward a broader AI operations and MLOps-oriented platform.

---

## Why This Exists

Most AI projects focus on prompts, agents, RAG, embeddings, or model calls.

That is enough for prototypes.

Once AI moves to production, the hard problem becomes execution:

- How do you coordinate multiple workers?
- How do you avoid duplicate execution?
- How do you recover after crashes?
- How do you replay an execution?
- How do you control retries?
- How do you throttle providers and models?
- How do you keep memory bounded?
- How do you resolve context safely across steps, payloads, providers, and policies?
- How do you pause, resume, or cancel safely?
- How do you support human-in-the-loop workflows?
- How do you prove deterministic convergence?

This runtime exists to address those production execution concerns.

---

## The Production AI Execution Problem

Production AI workloads are no longer single prompts running in isolation.

They become distributed execution systems with:

- multiple pipeline steps
- parallel branches
- dependencies
- retries
- external providers
- large payloads
- compacted or externalized state
- context resolution across previous step outputs
- failure recovery
- operational controls
- audit and replay requirements
- multiple workers or runtime instances

Without a real execution runtime, these systems often become fragile:

- hidden retry loops
- duplicated work
- lost state
- corrupted execution progress
- unbounded memory growth
- unclear ownership
- inconsistent input/context reconstruction
- poor or fragmented observability
- impossible replay

This project explores what an AI execution runtime should look like when reliability, determinism, context resolution, and distributed coordination are treated as first-class design requirements.

The runtime is intentionally split into layers:

- orchestration starts and manages executions
- DAG state determines what can run
- context helpers resolve inputs, payloads, metadata, and policy context
- Redis coordinates distributed workers
- policies control runtime behavior
- workers execute claimed steps
- persistence stores large payloads and snapshots
- replay validates deterministic reconstruction from persisted snapshots
- shared controller coordinates run admission, shared run persistence, global queue dispatch, queue pumping, and scale-out publication
- correlated observability records runtime behavior across ledger, metrics, traces, workers, and executions

## Enterprise Readiness

The project is designed around production questions that enterprise AI systems must answer.

| Enterprise Question | Runtime Direction |
|---|---|
| What happens if a worker crashes? | Running steps can be recovered through stale-claim detection and Redis-backed recovery. |
| How do you prevent duplicate executions? | Atomic Redis Lua claims and claim tokens enforce single step ownership. |
| How do you replay a workflow? | Terminal snapshots, replay metadata, deterministic fingerprint validation, audit-only replay, and restore replay provide replay foundations. |
| How do you audit an AI decision? | Execution-correlated decision ledger events, correlated metrics/traces, execution state, step results, retry metadata, recovery state, snapshots, replay reports, and observability provide audit foundations. |
| How do you limit concurrency? | Distributed Redis ZSET leases and policy-driven throttling enforce limits. |
| How do you resolve execution context safely? | Context helpers resolve inputs, step outputs, payload references, provider metadata, and policy context consistently. |
| How do you pause/resume/cancel safely? | Execution control state blocks new claims and coordinates deterministic finalization. |
| How do you control human-in-the-loop? | WaitingForInput and SubmitHumanInput are supported through durable control state. |
| How do you keep memory/state bounded? | Retention, compaction, eviction, and payload externalization control hot state size. |
| How do you coordinate multiple runtime instances? | Shared Redis state, Lua coordination, leases, shared run records, Redis-backed shared queue claims, queue pump/background consumption, and deterministic convergence enable coordination. |
| How do you prove deterministic convergence? | Integration tests and enterprise demo scenarios validate completion, replay fingerprints, distributed execution, throttling, recovery behavior, atomic retention, compaction consistency, ledger visibility, and trace timeline visibility. |
| How does this evolve toward AI operations and MLOps? | Runtime foundations are designed to support future AI execution control planes, governance, observability, replay, and operational workflows. |

## Runtime Control Plane

The runtime includes an adapter-neutral control-plane foundation for operational runtime control.

The control plane currently exposes foundations for:

- replay and audit control
- execution control
- local runtime queue control
- runtime instance registration and heartbeat
- runtime instance visibility and draining
- run admission / slot decisions
- Shared Runtime Controller V1
- shared run persistence
- Redis-backed shared run store
- Redis-backed shared queue
- direct assigned-run dispatch
- global shared queue dispatch
- shared queue pump
- hosted shared queue background consumption
- scale-out request publication
- future API, MCP, CLI, dashboard, and Kubernetes adapters

The control plane is also split into two identity levels.

```text
RunId
= controller / queue / background job lifecycle id

ExecutionId
= authoritative durable DAG execution id
```

This separation allows the runtime to manage queue-level work without confusing it with durable execution state.

### ExecutionId-Level Control

Implemented execution control capabilities include:

- pause execution
- resume execution
- cancel execution
- wait for human input
- submit human input
- block new claims based on control state
- cancellation finalization override

### RunId-Level Queue Control

Implemented controller queue capabilities include:

- pause queue
- resume queue
- cancel queued run
- cancel running run by bridging to ExecutionId cancellation
- hot enqueue while controller is running
- hot enqueue while queue is paused

This makes the runtime controllable, not only executable.

### Runtime Instance Control

Implemented runtime instance capabilities include:

- register runtime instance
- heartbeat runtime instance
- get runtime instance status
- list runtime instances
- expose local queue pressure
- expose available run slots
- mark runtime instance as draining
- unregister runtime instance

These foundations prepare the runtime for Kubernetes pod visibility, shared admission, dashboards, and future autoscaling.

### Run Admission / Slot Decisions

Implemented admission capabilities include:

- assign a run to an available runtime instance
- prefer a requested runtime instance when available
- select the least-loaded available instance
- request scale-out when no instance has capacity
- queue globally later when shared queue fallback is enabled
- reject when no capacity or fallback exists

Admission does not enqueue runs directly.

It only decides what should happen next. The shared runtime controller now applies that decision by dispatching assigned runs, enqueueing globally queued runs, publishing scale-out requests, or recording rejected runs.

### Shared Runtime Controller V1

Implemented shared controller capabilities include:

- submit shared run
- get shared run
- list shared runs
- cancel shared run
- assign run to runtime instance
- dispatch assigned run locally
- queue run globally
- claim globally queued run
- dispatch globally queued run
- requeue failed dispatch
- mark shared run dispatched
- mark shared queue item dispatched
- publish scale-out request
- pump shared queue manually
- consume shared queue through hosted background service
- coordinate shared queue dispatch through Redis
- prevent double dispatch through Redis atomic claim

The current shared controller flow is:

```text
SubmitRun
  -> IAiRunAdmissionController

  -> AssignToInstance
      -> IAiSharedRunStore.CreateAsync(...)
      -> IAiSharedRunDispatcher.DispatchAsync(...)
      -> IAiSharedRunStore.MarkDispatchedAsync(...)
      -> SharedRun.Status = Dispatched

  -> QueueGlobally
      -> IAiSharedRunStore.CreateAsync(...)
      -> IAiSharedQueue.EnqueueAsync(...)
      -> SharedRun.Status = QueuedGlobally

  -> RequestScaleOut
      -> IAiSharedRunStore.CreateAsync(...)
      -> IAiRuntimeScaleOutRequestPublisher.PublishAsync(...)
      -> SharedRun.Status = ScaleOutRequested

  -> Reject
      -> IAiSharedRunStore.CreateAsync(...)
      -> SharedRun.Status = Rejected
```

For details, see [`docs/ai/runtime-control-plane.md`](docs/ai/runtime-control-plane.md).

---

## Distributed Execution and Coordination

The runtime uses Redis as a hot state and coordination layer.

Redis is not only used as a cache. It is used as the active distributed execution state.

Critical operations include:

- creating execution state
- claiming ready DAG steps
- validating claim ownership
- completing steps
- failing steps
- scheduling retries
- recovering stale running steps
- enforcing distributed concurrency leases
- storing execution control state

Redis Lua scripts are used for atomic transitions where race conditions must be avoided.

This allows multiple workers or runtime instances to cooperate safely without direct worker-to-worker communication.

---

## Context Resolution and Runtime Helpers

The runtime includes a helper layer that connects declarative configuration to concrete execution behavior.

This layer resolves:

- input bindings from execution state
- previous step outputs
- compacted or externalized payloads
- provider, providerKey, model, and operation metadata
- retry policy context
- retention policy context
- concurrency context
- RAG retrieval, merge, and compose context
- replay-safe comparison data

This keeps the DAG engine focused on orchestration and prevents plugins, policies, and providers from manually reconstructing raw execution state.

For details, see [`docs/ai/context-resolution-and-helpers.md`](docs/ai/context-resolution-and-helpers.md).

---

## Observability, Replay, and Audit Foundations

The runtime includes foundations for production visibility and replayability:

- execution lifecycle metrics
- retry and recovery metrics
- retention metrics
- resolver metrics
- storage metrics
- context resolution diagnostics
- concurrency admission diagnostics
- realtime runtime events
- readable console runtime events
- execution-correlated decision ledger
- durable runtime lifecycle audit events
- claim, concurrency, retry, and recovery audit visibility
- queue and execution control audit visibility
- atomic retention and compaction auditability
- shared runtime controller foundations
- Redis-backed shared queue coordination
- queue pump and background consumption
- scale-out request publication
- snapshot persistence audit events
- replay lifecycle ledger events
- replay metadata
- replay report generation
- replay snapshot loading
- replay deterministic fingerprint validation
- replay dependency graph validation
- replay step state validation
- replay payload reference validation
- replay ledger event loading
- replay trace timeline loading
- replay diagnostic output for ledger and timeline inspection
- correlated trace recording foundations
- correlated metric and trace storage modes
- in-memory, MongoDB, and MemoryAndMongo observability persistence
- terminal snapshots
- replay restoration
- deterministic replay fingerprint validation

Runtime metrics and traces can be configured as `Disabled`, `Memory`, `Mongo`, or `MemoryAndMongo`. This allows local diagnostics, durable MongoDB-backed inspection, or both at the same time while keeping the execution runtime independent from observability storage choices.

Replay can validate persisted executions without re-running LLMs, tools, external providers, or side effects. It can expose replay metadata, decision ledger events, and trace timeline events when requested.

OpenTelemetry-style distributed tracing, richer dashboards, HTTP replay APIs, replay audit tooling, and advanced decision lineage remain roadmap items.

---

## Current Status

---

## Enterprise Runtime Demo

A local enterprise-oriented demo is available in [`demo/enterprise-runtime/`](demo/enterprise-runtime/README.md).

The demo is designed to prove that the runtime behaves like distributed AI execution infrastructure, not a toy agent framework.

It currently includes:

- Docker Compose infrastructure for Redis and MongoDB
- scenario documentation for enterprise runtime behaviors
- an external sample step plugin under `Samples/Multiplexed.Sample.External.Plugins.Steps`
- a JSON pipeline at `demo/enterprise-runtime/pipelines/enterprise-demo-pipeline.json`
- interactive console scenario selection
- distributed runtime worker participation
- realtime readable runtime logs
- live progress output
- execution pause, resume, and cancel controls
- retry recovery summaries
- retention and hot-state summaries
- replay validation for supported scenarios
- replay metadata, ledger, and timeline diagnostics in integration tests
- distributed provider throttling through the `throttling-100` scenario
- `RunId` and `ExecutionId` separation
- terminal completion through the controller path
- execution-correlated runtime ledger visibility
- correlated metrics and tracing diagnostics
- MemoryAndMongo observability validation
- queue and execution control audit events
- retry, recovery, and concurrency ledger validation
- atomic retention and compaction auditability
- shared runtime controller foundations
- Redis-backed shared queue coordination
- queue pump and background consumption
- scale-out request publication

The current executable console scenarios are:

```text
json
chaos-100
chaos-500
throttling-100
```

The `throttling-100` scenario demonstrates:

- distributed provider throttling
- Redis lease-based concurrency admission
- realtime `[THROTTLED]` visibility
- randomized provider distribution with OpenAI as the throttled target
- bounded provider capacity under worker pressure
- deterministic convergence despite throttling delays

The demo validates the controller execution path, distributed worker participation, runtime controls, realtime logging, correlated observability, and terminal completion behavior. It is intended to show distributed AI execution infrastructure, not only a simple batch or in-memory execution path.

Future demo work will expand further into crash recovery, human-in-the-loop, advanced replay workflows, Kubernetes deployment assets, real enterprise sample workflows, and broader AI operations/MLOps-oriented runtime capabilities.
