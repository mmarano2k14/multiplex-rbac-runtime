# Execution-Correlated Decision Ledger

Status: Implemented foundation. Replay-specific ledger events are deferred until the official Replay API.

This document describes the execution-correlated decision ledger foundations of the Deterministic AI Runtime.

The ledger records structured runtime decisions and lifecycle transitions that are correlated by `ExecutionId`, `RunId`, step identity, worker/runtime instance, claim token, and optional concurrency context.

The complete technical reference is preserved in:

- [runtime-internals.md](../runtime-internals.md)

---

## Purpose

Production AI execution must be observable, auditable, and explainable.

Logs are useful for operators, but logs alone are not enough to explain distributed runtime decisions.

The decision ledger exists to answer questions such as:

- when was the execution created?
- when was a run queued, dequeued, started, completed, failed, or cancelled?
- why was a step claimed or denied?
- which worker claimed a step?
- which claim token owned the step?
- which concurrency lease was acquired or released?
- was a retry evaluated, scheduled, denied, or exhausted?
- was recovery detected and applied?
- which policy allowed, denied, or failed?
- when was the queue paused or resumed?
- when was execution control state changed?
- when did human input get requested or submitted?
- was a terminal snapshot persisted?
- did storage persistence fail?
- how can future replay/audit tooling reconstruct what happened?

The ledger is designed as structured evidence of runtime behavior.

It is not a replacement for logs, metrics, or traces. It complements them.

---

## Current Scope

The current implementation provides execution-correlated ledger foundations across the runtime.

Implemented ledger areas include:

- execution lifecycle
- controller run lifecycle
- queue control
- distributed claim lifecycle
- step execution lifecycle
- retry decisions
- recovery decisions
- policy evaluation decisions
- concurrency and throttling decisions
- execution control state
- human input control
- retention and compaction auditability
- payload lifecycle foundations
- snapshot persistence
- storage persistence failure
- finalization lifecycle and race outcomes

Replay-specific ledger events are intentionally not implemented yet.

They will be added with the official Replay API, where replay orchestration, replay validation, comparison, and lineage can be recorded at the correct API boundary.

---

## Why a Decision Ledger Matters

Distributed AI workflows are not simple method calls.

A production AI workflow may involve:

- multiple runtime instances
- multiple workers
- DAG dependencies
- Redis Lua atomic claims
- retry scheduling
- stale-worker recovery
- hot-state retention
- payload compaction
- externalized payloads
- provider/model throttling
- queue control
- execution pause/resume/cancel
- human-in-the-loop waiting
- terminal snapshot persistence
- finalization races

When something happens in such a system, the important question is not only:

```text
What log line was printed?
```

The important question is:

```text
Which runtime decision was made, why, by whom, against which execution, and with which state context?
```

The decision ledger provides a durable and queryable foundation for that answer.

---

## Ledger vs Logs vs Metrics vs Traces

The runtime uses multiple observability layers.

| Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Logs | Human-readable operational messages. |
| Metrics | Aggregated counters, durations, and runtime health signals. |
| Traces | Timeline and distributed flow diagnostics. |
| Decision ledger | Structured runtime decisions and lifecycle facts correlated to execution state. |

The decision ledger is more structured than logs and more decision-oriented than metrics.

A log may say:

```text
[AI DAG] Step claimed.
```

A ledger entry should record:

```text
ExecutionId
PipelineKey
StepName
StepKey
WorkerId
ClaimToken
Category
EventType
Outcome
Reason
Metadata
TimestampUtc
```

This makes the event queryable, auditable, and usable by future replay/audit tooling.

---

## Correlation Model

Ledger entries are correlated through `AiRuntimeCorrelationContext`.

The correlation context may include:

- `ExecutionId`
- `CorrelationId`
- `PipelineKey`
- `StepName`
- `StepKey`
- `WorkerId`
- `ClaimToken`
- concurrency scope information
- provider/model/operation information
- payload/input/human input references where applicable

The goal is to make every important event explainable in relation to the execution it belongs to.

---

## RunId and ExecutionId Separation

The runtime separates controller lifecycle identity from durable DAG execution identity.

```text
RunId
= controller / queue / background run lifecycle id

ExecutionId
= authoritative durable DAG execution id
```

The decision ledger respects this separation.

Examples:

```text
run.queued
run.dequeued
```

may exist before the authoritative `ExecutionId` is available.

Once execution is created, later run events become execution-correlated.

This avoids confusing queue/controller lifecycle with durable DAG execution state.

---

## Ledger Entry Shape

A decision ledger entry contains structured information such as:

```text
EntryId
Sequence
TimestampUtc
Category
EventType
Outcome
Reason
CorrelationContext
Metadata
```

The runtime currently uses stable string event constants instead of a very large enum.

This keeps the ledger extensible while still avoiding magic strings across the runtime.

---

## Event Categories

The current ledger event constants are grouped by runtime domain.

Implemented or foundation-ready categories include:

- `Execution`
- `Run`
- `Queue`
- `Dag`
- `Claim`
- `Step`
- `Recovery`
- `Retry`
- `Policy`
- `Concurrency`
- `Control`
- `HumanInput`
- `Retention`
- `Payload`
- `Snapshot`
- `Storage`
- `Finalization`
- `Replay`

Replay constants exist as a planned category, but replay events are intentionally deferred until the official Replay API.

---

## Execution Events

Execution events describe durable execution lifecycle transitions.

Current execution events include:

```text
execution.created
execution.started
execution.completed
execution.failed
execution.cancelled
execution.finalized
```

These events are used to understand the lifecycle of the authoritative execution.

Execution events are correlated by `ExecutionId`.

---

## Run Events

Run events describe controller-level run lifecycle transitions.

Current run events include:

```text
run.queued
run.dequeued
run.started
run.completed
run.failed
run.cancelled
```

Run events are important because the controller may know about a run before durable DAG execution state exists.

They provide visibility into:

- queue acceptance
- dequeue behavior
- controller start
- controller completion
- controller failure
- cancellation flow

---

## Queue Events

Queue events describe runtime queue control.

Current queue events include:

```text
queue.paused
queue.resumed
```

These events make queue-level operational control auditable.

Queue events are especially useful for explaining why runs were delayed or why a controller was not dequeuing work.

---

## Claim Events

Claim events describe distributed DAG claim decisions.

Current claim events include:

```text
claim.attempted
claim.acquired
claim.denied
claim.expired
claim.released
claim.lease_renewed
claim.lease_expired
```

The currently integrated runtime flow records the core claim lifecycle:

- claim attempted
- claim acquired
- claim denied

Claim events are essential for proving duplicate execution prevention.

They show which worker attempted to claim work, which claim succeeded, and why a claim was denied.

---

## Step Events

Step events describe physical step execution.

Current step events include:

```text
step.started
step.completed
step.failed
step.timed_out
```

The current runtime records:

- step started
- step completed
- step failed

These events are emitted from the claimed-step executor and are correlated with:

- `ExecutionId`
- step name
- step key
- worker id
- claim token
- optional concurrency context

Step events are runtime-side execution evidence.

They do not replace persisted step state.

---

## Retry Events

Retry events describe retry decision outcomes after a failed step transition has been persisted.

Current retry events include:

```text
retry.evaluated
retry.scheduled
retry.denied
retry.attempt_started
retry.attempt_completed
retry.budget_exhausted
```

The current runtime records:

- `retry.evaluated`
- `retry.scheduled`
- `retry.denied`
- `retry.budget_exhausted`

These are recorded after the failed step transition is persisted and the step state is reloaded.

This is important because retry ledger events must reflect the durable result, not only an in-memory decision.

Typical metadata includes:

- step name
- step key
- failure source
- error
- step status
- retry count
- max retries
- next retry timestamp

`retry.attempt_started` and `retry.attempt_completed` remain future candidates for the point where a waiting-for-retry step is actually reclaimed and executed again.

---

## Recovery Events

Recovery events describe distributed recovery after stale running work is detected.

Current recovery events include:

```text
recovery.detected
recovery.applied
recovery.step_recovered
recovery.execution_recovered
```

The current runtime records step-level recovery events:

- `recovery.detected`
- `recovery.applied`
- `recovery.step_recovered`

These events are emitted when timed-out running steps are recovered through the distributed DAG store.

`recovery.execution_recovered` is reserved for future execution-level recovery flows.

---

## Policy Events

Policy events describe step-scoped policy evaluation.

Current policy events include:

```text
policy.evaluated
policy.allowed
policy.denied
policy.skipped
policy.failed
```

The current runtime records:

- `policy.evaluated`
- `policy.allowed`
- `policy.denied`
- `policy.failed`

Policy decisions are recorded by the shared policy engine base class.

This keeps policy audit consistent across retry, retention, concurrency, and future policy domains.

`policy.skipped` is intentionally not emitted for an empty policy list.

It should only be used when a policy was deliberately skipped by runtime logic.

---

## Concurrency Events

Concurrency events describe distributed admission and throttling behavior.

Current concurrency events include:

```text
concurrency.evaluated
concurrency.allowed
concurrency.denied
concurrency.throttle_applied
concurrency.lease_acquired
concurrency.lease_released
concurrency.lease_expired
```

The current runtime records the most important distributed concurrency events:

- `concurrency.denied`
- `concurrency.lease_acquired`
- `concurrency.lease_released`

These events explain why a step was admitted, denied, or released.

They are especially important for provider/model/operation throttling.

Metadata may include:

- pipeline key
- step name
- step key
- worker id
- lease id
- claim mode

---

## Control Events

Control events describe durable execution control state.

Current control events include:

```text
control.pause_requested
control.paused
control.resume_requested
control.resumed
control.cancel_requested
control.cancel_observed
control.state_changed
```

These events make pause, resume, and cancellation auditable.

The control service records operator/system intent.

The DAG claim service can record when control state blocks advancement.

This separation is important:

```text
control.cancel_requested
= cancellation was requested

control.cancel_observed
= runtime observed cancellation while attempting to advance
```

---

## Human Input Events

Human input events describe human-in-the-loop state.

Current human input events include:

```text
human_input.requested
human_input.submitted
human_input.rejected
human_input.expired
human_input.waiting
```

The current runtime records:

- `human_input.requested`
- `human_input.waiting`
- `human_input.submitted`

These events explain when execution entered a waiting state and when external input was submitted.

Metadata may include:

- waiting key
- waiting step name
- requested by
- submitted by
- input key count
- control status
- pending action

---

## Retention Events

Retention events describe hot-state lifecycle decisions.

Current retention events include:

```text
retention.evaluated
retention.triggered
retention.skipped
retention.compacted
retention.evicted
```

Retention and compaction are critical because the runtime must keep Redis hot state bounded without destroying replay-critical data.

The decision ledger foundations support auditability for:

- retention evaluation
- retention trigger decisions
- payload compaction
- hot-state eviction
- atomic retention patch application
- resolver-safe evicted step reconstruction

Retention events are related to but separate from snapshot and replay events.

Retention controls hot state.

Snapshots and payload storage preserve durable replay data.

---

## Payload Events

Payload events describe payload lifecycle transitions.

Current payload events include:

```text
payload.externalized
payload.rehydrated
payload.resolution_failed
```

Payload event coverage is important because large result payloads may be compacted or externalized.

When payloads move out of hot state, the runtime must still be able to resolve them through payload references and archive indexes.

Payload events are useful for future audit tooling and replay diagnostics.

---

## Snapshot Events

Snapshot events describe durable terminal snapshot lifecycle.

Current snapshot events include:

```text
snapshot.created
snapshot.loaded
snapshot.restore_requested
snapshot.restore_completed
```

The current runtime records:

```text
snapshot.created
```

after terminal snapshot persistence succeeds.

This provides audit evidence that a replay-critical artifact was persisted.

Replay-related snapshot restore events are deferred until the official Replay API.

---

## Storage Events

Storage events describe durable state persistence outcomes.

Current storage events include:

```text
storage.state_persisted
storage.state_persistence_failed
```

The current runtime records:

```text
storage.state_persistence_failed
```

when best-effort snapshot persistence fails.

Snapshot persistence remains best-effort and must not affect execution reliability.

The ledger makes the failure visible without changing execution outcome.

---

## Finalization Events

Finalization events describe terminal convergence and distributed finalization behavior.

Current finalization events include:

```text
finalization.started
finalization.completed
finalization.failed
finalization.cancellation_override_applied
finalization.race_lost
```

These events are important in a distributed runtime because multiple workers may observe terminal convergence at nearly the same time.

Only one worker should win finalization.

`finalization.race_lost` is not a system failure.

It is an expected distributed coordination outcome.

---

## Replay Events

Replay event constants exist but replay ledger recording is intentionally deferred.

Replay event constants include:

```text
replay.requested
replay.started
replay.completed
replay.failed
replay.comparison_completed
replay.convergence_proof_started
replay.convergence_proof_completed
replay.convergence_proof_failed
```

These events should be recorded later by the official Replay API and replay orchestration layer.

They should not be emitted prematurely by the core runtime.

Replay-specific audit should live where replay intent, replay validation, comparison, and lineage are known.

---

## Atomic Retention and Compaction Auditability

The ledger work also supports the retention and compaction improvements.

The runtime validates that aggressive retention can:

- compact payload data
- evict hot-state step payloads
- preserve completed step shells
- keep resolver reconstruction working
- preserve retry counts
- reconstruct fingerprint steps
- keep terminal execution consistent

The ledger foundations make these flows auditable.

This is important because retention is not only a memory optimization.

Retention affects long-running execution correctness, replay readiness, and post-execution inspection.

---

## Execution-Correlated Runtime Domains

The current execution-correlated ledger covers these runtime domains:

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Execution | Durable execution lifecycle. |
| Run | Controller run lifecycle. |
| Queue | Queue pause/resume control. |
| Claim | Distributed claim decisions. |
| Step | Physical step execution. |
| Retry | Retry evaluation and scheduling. |
| Recovery | Stale running-step recovery. |
| Policy | Policy evaluation and results. |
| Concurrency | Distributed throttling and lease lifecycle. |
| Control | Pause, resume, cancel, and control state. |
| HumanInput | Human-in-the-loop waiting and submission. |
| Retention | Hot-state lifecycle and compaction decisions. |
| Payload | Payload externalization and rehydration foundations. |
| Snapshot | Terminal snapshot persistence. |
| Storage | Persistence failure visibility. |
| Finalization | Terminal convergence and race outcomes. |

---

## Ledger Write Behavior

The ledger recorder supports configurable write behavior.

Typical write modes include:

- disabled
- best-effort
- strict or fail-fast behavior where configured

Best-effort mode is important for production execution reliability.

Ledger failure should not necessarily break workflow execution unless explicitly configured to do so.

This allows the runtime to preserve execution safety while still producing audit evidence whenever possible.

---

## Testing Coverage

The ledger integration is validated through integration and runtime tests covering:

- run lifecycle events
- queue pause/resume events
- execution control events
- human input events
- claim events
- retry events
- recovery events
- policy events
- concurrency events
- snapshot events
- storage failure events
- finalization events
- aggressive retention and compaction
- evicted-step resolver reconstruction
- 100-step distributed chaos execution
- 500-step aggressive retention execution

The tests also validated regressions around:

- queue ledger correlation
- RunId vs ExecutionId semantics
- handle usage in controller tests
- retention policy non-terminal filtering
- aggressive retention hot-state behavior
- resolver consistency after eviction
- premature DAG ready-step event emission

---

The following output is produced by the integration test:

...

```

---

## Events Intentionally Deferred

Some event types exist but are intentionally not fully emitted yet.

Deferred events include:

- `dag.step_became_ready`
- `dag.step_blocked`
- `dag.step_unblocked`
- `dag.step_skipped`
- `retry.attempt_started`
- `retry.attempt_completed`
- `recovery.execution_recovered`
- replay events

These are deferred because they require precise runtime placement.

For example, `dag.step_became_ready` must be emitted only after persisted DAG completion state is stable.

Adding it too early can observe stale state and interfere with retention-heavy tests.

---

## Design Principles

The ledger follows these principles:

1. Record structured runtime decisions, not noisy log lines.
2. Correlate by `ExecutionId` wherever possible.
3. Preserve `RunId` vs `ExecutionId` separation.
4. Do not emit replay events before the Replay API owns replay intent.
5. Do not put orchestration decisions inside low-level stores unless necessary.
6. Prefer runtime-layer ledger emission for runtime decisions.
7. Keep store-level code focused on atomic persistence.
8. Do not break execution reliability if best-effort ledger persistence fails.
9. Avoid duplicate or misleading events.
10. Emit events only after durable state has reached the decision being recorded.

---

## Relationship to Replay and Audit

The ledger is a foundation for future replay and audit capabilities.

Replay answers:

```text
Can I restore and compare execution state?
```

The ledger helps answer:

```text
What happened before, during, and after that execution?
```

Together, snapshots, replay, resolver reconstruction, and decision ledger entries will allow future tooling to provide:

- replay timelines
- audit trails
- decision history
- runtime control history
- retry/recovery explanation
- provider throttling explanation
- retention and compaction inspection
- finalization race explanation

Replay-specific ledger events remain planned for the Replay API.

## Responsibilities by Component

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `AiRuntimeObservability` | Exposes metrics, tracing, logging, and decision ledger recorder as a runtime facade. |
| `IAiDecisionLedgerRecorder` | Records ledger entries according to configured write mode. |
| `AiRuntimeCorrelationContextHelper` | Creates stable execution correlation context. |
| Runtime controller | Records run and queue lifecycle events. |
| Execution control service | Records control and human-input lifecycle events. |
| DAG claim service | Records claim, recovery, control-blocking, waiting, and concurrency decisions. |
| Claimed step executor | Records step execution and concurrency lease release events. |
| Policy engine | Records policy evaluation and decision events. |
| Retry ledger helper | Records retry decision outcomes after persisted failure transitions. |
| Snapshot service | Records snapshot persistence and storage failure events. |
| Finalization service | Records terminal finalization events and race outcomes. |
| Future Replay API | Will record replay-specific events and decision lineage. |

## Documentation Rule

This document is a focused extraction and update based on the current execution-correlated ledger implementation.

The original technical depth remains preserved in:

- [runtime-internals.md](../runtime-internals.md)

Do not remove content from `runtime-internals.md` until the extracted documentation has been reviewed and validated.
