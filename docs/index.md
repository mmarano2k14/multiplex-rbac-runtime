# Documentation Index

This directory contains the documentation for **Deterministic AI Runtime**.

The main repository README is intentionally short. It explains the project, its purpose, current capabilities, and roadmap.

## Documentation Status

Many focused documents started as documentation split placeholders, but several core runtime areas are now fully documented, including execution control state, runtime queue control, runtime control-plane foundations, distributed concurrency, retention/compaction, deterministic replay and audit foundations, execution-correlated decision ledger foundations, observability/tracing foundations, and runtime metrics foundations.

The complete technical reference remains preserved in:

- [`runtime-internals.md`](runtime-internals.md)

Focused documents should be expanded progressively by extracting, refining, and linking content from `runtime-internals.md`.

---

## Documentation Rule

The original technical depth must be preserved.

New focused documents should be extracted from `runtime-internals.md` gradually.

Do not delete technical content until it has been safely moved, reviewed, and linked from this index.

When adding new documentation:

1. Add core documentation directly under `docs/`.
2. Add focused AI runtime documentation under `docs/ai/`.
3. Link new documents from this index.
4. Keep links relative to this file.
5. Preserve the complete technical reference in `runtime-internals.md`.
6. Clearly distinguish between implemented features, available foundations, and planned work.
7. Keep replay documentation connected to ledger, tracing, and metrics because Replay V1 now exposes replay metadata, replay lifecycle ledger events, and trace timeline diagnostics.
8. Keep observability overview, tracing, runtime metrics, and replay/audit linked together because they describe different layers of the same runtime visibility model.
9. Keep runtime control-plane documentation linked with runtime queue control, execution control state, instance visibility, admission, and future Kubernetes/shared-controller documentation.
