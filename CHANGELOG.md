## [1.0.5.0] - 2026-05-20 - Execution Control State / Queue Control / Human-in-the-Loop

### Added

- Added durable execution control state support for runtime-level execution governance.
- Added `AiExecutionControlState` to separate operator/user/system control state from DAG execution state.
- Added `AiExecutionControlStatus` with support for:
  - `None`
  - `Running`
  - `Pausing`
  - `Paused`
  - `Resuming`
  - `Cancelling`
  - `Cancelled`
  - `WaitingForInput`
- Added `AiExecutionControlAction` to separate requested control intent from effective runtime state.
- Added `AiExecutionControlDecision` to centralize runtime decisions for claim blocking, cancellation, and human-input waiting.
- Added `IAiExecutionControlStore` for durable distributed execution control persistence.
- Added `IAiExecutionControlService` for high-level execution control operations:
  - `PauseExecutionAsync`
  - `MarkPausedAsync`
  - `ResumeExecutionAsync`
  - `MarkRunningAsync`
  - `CancelExecutionAsync`
  - `MarkWaitingForInputAsync`
  - `SubmitHumanInputAsync`
  - `CheckCanAdvanceAsync`
- Added `IAiExecutionControlGate` as a small runtime-facing control gate used before execution advancement.
- Added Redis-backed execution control store:
  - `RedisAiExecutionControlStore`
  - `RedisExecutionControlKeyBuilder`
  - `RedisExecutionControlLuaScripts`
- Added Redis key namespace for control state:
  - `ai:execution:control:{executionId}`
- Added optimistic versioning support for distributed-safe execution control updates.
- Added Redis Lua compare-and-set update for versioned control state transitions.
- Added atomic `TryCreateAsync` support to safely create control state when it does not yet exist.
- Added execution control service registration in dependency injection.
- Added runtime control gate registration in dependency injection.

### Execution Control

- Added execution-level pause support.
- Pause now stops new DAG step claims for the target `ExecutionId`.
- Already claimed/running work is allowed to finish safely.
- Added transition from `Pausing` to `Paused` once the runtime observes that no active claimed or running work remains.
- Added execution-level resume support.
- Resume moves an execution into `Resuming`.
- Runtime claim cycle now normalizes `Resuming` to `Running` once execution advancement is allowed again.
- Added execution-level cancellation support.
- Cancellation blocks new claims and marks the execution as cancelling.
- Added cancellation precedence during DAG finalization.
- If DAG convergence naturally produces `Completed` while execution control is `Cancelling`, final persisted execution status is now `Cancelled`.
- Added human-in-the-loop waiting support.
- Runtime can mark an execution as `WaitingForInput`.
- Waiting executions block new claims.
- Human input submission persists input into execution control state.
- Submitting human input moves execution into `Resuming`.
- Runtime later normalizes the execution back to `Running`.

### Runtime Integration

- Integrated `IAiExecutionControlGate` into the DAG step claim path.
- Added control checks before single-step claim.
- Added control checks before batch-step claim.
- Control checks now block step claiming for:
  - `Pausing`
  - `Paused`
  - `WaitingForInput`
  - `Cancelling`
  - `Cancelled`
- Control checks allow advancement for:
  - `None`
  - `Running`
  - `Resuming`
- Added runtime transition handling:
  - `Pausing` + no active work -> `Paused`
  - `Resuming` + claim cycle observed -> `Running`
- Integrated cancellation override into `AiDagExecutionFinalizationService`.
- Updated finalization so cancelled executions cannot incorrectly converge as completed.

### Controller / Queue Control

- Added controller-level queue pause and resume support.
- Added `PauseQueueAsync` to `IAiRuntimePipelineBackgroundController`.
- Added `ResumeQueueAsync` to `IAiRuntimePipelineBackgroundController`.
- Queue pause prevents new queued runs from starting.
- Queue pause does not stop already-running executions.
- Queue resume allows queued runs to start again.
- Added queued run tracking inside `AiRuntimePipelineBackgroundController`.
- Added `_queuedRuns` tracking for queued-but-not-started runs.
- Added `_runningRuns` tracking for started controller runs.
- Added `CancelQueuedRunAsync` support.
- Queued runs can now be cancelled before execution creation.
- Cancelled queued runs do not create a durable `ExecutionId`.
- Cancelled queued runs complete their handle with `AiExecutionStatus.Cancelled`.
- Added `CancelRunAsync` support.
- `CancelRunAsync` cancels queued runs directly when they have not started.
- `CancelRunAsync` delegates to `IAiExecutionControlService.CancelExecutionAsync` when the run is already running and has an `ExecutionId`.
- Added RunId-to-ExecutionId cancellation bridge.
- Running run cancellation now results in durable execution cancellation.
- Updated controller run terminal handling so final `AiExecutionStatus.Cancelled` maps to `AiRuntimeWorkerRunStatus.Cancelled`.
- Added hot enqueue behavior validation.
- Runs can be added while the controller is already processing another run.
- Runs can be added while the queue is paused and start only after resume.

### Improved

- Improved separation between controller lifecycle and execution lifecycle:
  - `RunId` is controlled by the background pipeline controller.
  - `ExecutionId` is controlled by durable execution state and execution control state.
- Improved state-machine clarity by separating:
  - requested action
  - effective runtime control status
  - runtime decision
- Improved distributed safety of control transitions using optimistic version checks.
- Improved finalization correctness under cancellation races.
- Improved queue control semantics without impacting already-running executions.
- Improved worker/controller distinction:
  - queue control belongs to `AiRuntimePipelineBackgroundController`
  - execution advancement belongs to `AiRuntimeInstanceWorker`
  - execution state control belongs to `IAiExecutionControlService`
- Improved cancellation semantics for running controller runs by reusing the existing execution control layer instead of duplicating cancellation logic.
- Improved test coverage around pause, resume, cancellation, waiting-for-input, queued cancellation, running cancellation, and hot enqueue behavior.

### Tests

- Added Redis execution control store tests:
  - set/get control state
  - missing state returns null
  - versioned update succeeds when expected version matches
  - versioned update fails when expected version does not match
  - delete removes control state
  - waiting-for-input metadata and input are persisted
- Added execution control service tests:
  - pause creates pausing state
  - resume creates resuming state
  - cancel creates cancelling state
  - cancellation wins over resume
  - waiting-for-input blocks advancement
  - human input submission resumes execution
  - invalid waiting key throws
  - no control state allows advancement
- Added claim-blocking integration tests:
  - pausing execution does not claim ready work
  - waiting-for-input execution does not claim ready work
  - cancelling execution does not claim ready work
  - no control state claims normally
  - pausing execution becomes paused after active work drains
  - paused execution resumes and claims work
  - waiting-for-input execution resumes after human input
  - resuming execution becomes running after runtime advancement
- Added finalization integration test:
  - cancelling execution overrides natural completed convergence and persists final status as cancelled
- Added controller queue-control integration tests:
  - pause queue prevents queued run from starting
  - resume queue allows queued run to complete
  - pause queue does not stop already-running execution
  - cancel queued run before execution creation
  - cancelling unknown queued run returns false
  - cancel running run delegates to execution control and persists cancelled status
  - hot enqueue while controller is running
  - hot enqueue while queue is paused
- Revalidated existing distributed scenarios after execution-control integration.
- Revalidated aggressive chaos scenarios with 100-step and 500-step distributed executions.

### Architecture

- Introduced a clear two-layer control architecture:

  - Layer 1: Controller / Queue / Run Control
    - `RunId`
    - queue pause/resume
    - queued run cancellation
    - running run cancellation bridge
    - hot enqueue

  - Layer 2: Execution Control
    - `ExecutionId`
    - pause/resume
    - cancellation
    - waiting for human input
    - submit human input
    - durable Redis control state

- Preserved separation between:
  - `AiExecutionState` for DAG state, step state, retry state, payload references, and convergence
  - `AiExecutionControlState` for operator/user/system control state
- Kept Redis control persistence separate from Redis DAG execution state.
- Kept execution control separate from controller queue control.
- Kept cancellation semantics cooperative and deterministic.
- Avoided hard termination of already running claimed steps.
- Preserved deterministic convergence and distributed safety.

### Notes

- Queue pause does not pause already-running executions.
- Execution pause does not cancel already-running claimed steps; it prevents new claims and waits for active work to drain.
- Queue cancellation before execution creation does not create a durable `ExecutionId`.
- Running run cancellation uses the existing execution-control layer and therefore follows the same deterministic cancellation/finalization behavior as direct execution cancellation.
- Human input is persisted in durable execution control state and can later be extended into audit/replay control history.
- Control state is currently Redis-backed and can later be mirrored into Mongo snapshots or an append-only audit log.

## [1.0.4.8] - 2026-05-18 - Distributed Runtime Instances / Aggressive Retention Stabilization

### Added

- Added distributed runtime-instance execution support for background pipeline runs.
- Added support for running pipeline executions in two runtime modes:
  - single runtime-instance mode
  - distributed multi-runtime-instance mode
- Added distributed worker-group execution so multiple runtime workers can safely advance the same execution.
- Added configurable distributed runtime worker count for background-controller execution.
- Added runtime-instance worker factory support for creating isolated runtime workers.
- Added terminal run lifecycle hook support for observing finalized background pipeline runs.
- Added distributed chaos validation for:
  - 500-step DAG executions
  - 30 distributed runtime workers
  - bounded batch execution
  - retryable flaky steps
  - distributed concurrency
  - aggressive compaction
  - aggressive eviction
  - snapshot persistence
  - replay reconstruction
  - resolver consistency
  - repeated state reload validation
- Added long-running aggressive distributed chaos stress validation, skipped by default, for repeated stability testing.
- Added reconstruction validation ensuring evicted and compacted steps remain resolvable after aggressive retention.
- Added retry preservation validation ensuring retried steps remain completed and retain retry metadata after aggressive retention and replay.
- Added repeated reload validation to verify deterministic `GetStateAsync(...)` and resolver behavior after terminal retention.
- Added validation that hot state may be empty after terminal eviction when archive index and resolver reconstruction remain valid.

### Changed

- Hardened terminal lifecycle handling across:
  - local DAG execution
  - distributed DAG execution
  - batch DAG execution
- Added centralized terminal lifecycle orchestration through `EnsureTerminalLifecycleAsync(...)`.
- Updated local, distributed, and batch runners to consistently execute terminal lifecycle side effects through the lifecycle helper.
- Improved terminal snapshot lifecycle reliability by ensuring terminal paths attempt snapshot persistence and cleanup consistently.
- Made terminal lifecycle side effects idempotent for distributed workers that may observe the same terminal execution concurrently.
- Hardened distributed state reconstruction to prevent logically completed steps from reappearing in hot state as default `None` steps.
- Updated `GetStateAsync(...)` reconstruction semantics so stale `None` hot-state entries for logically completed steps are removed during state reload.
- Updated distributed state reconstruction so terminal hot-state consistency is preserved across:
  - state blob reload
  - indexed step-key overlay
  - aggressive retention
  - replay reconstruction
- Updated retention tests to reflect the correct retention model:
  - hot state is a bounded mutable window
  - archive index and payload resolver are authoritative for evicted terminal steps
  - a fully evicted terminal hot state can be valid
- Updated hybrid retention tests to validate bounded hot state instead of requiring hot state to remain non-empty.
- Improved resolver-oriented retention validation for archived steps after eviction.
- Stabilized aggressive retention behavior under repeated distributed reload and replay scenarios.

### Fixed

- Fixed intermittent terminal snapshot availability issues in distributed background execution.
- Fixed terminal lifecycle paths that could return terminal records without consistently attempting snapshot persistence.
- Fixed snapshot lifecycle races across local, distributed, and batch DAG runners.
- Fixed hot-state regression where a logically completed step could be reconstructed as `Status=None`.
- Fixed stale hot-state resurrection after aggressive eviction.
- Fixed distributed replay/reload scenarios where completed logical history remained correct but hot state could contain invalid default step entries.
- Fixed retention/reconstruction inconsistency between:
  - persisted completed-step history
  - hot execution state
  - archive index
  - payload-backed resolver
- Fixed aggressive retention instability where completed steps could become visible in hot state as non-terminal/default steps.
- Fixed hybrid retention test assumptions that required hot state to remain non-empty even when steps were correctly evicted and archived.

### Validated

- Validated both runtime execution modes:
  - non-distributed single runtime-instance execution
  - distributed multi-runtime-instance execution
- Validated repeated aggressive distributed chaos execution with:
  - 500 DAG steps
  - 30 distributed workers
  - retries
  - distributed concurrency
  - compaction
  - eviction
  - snapshot persistence
  - replay reconstruction
  - resolver consistency
- Validated long-running aggressive chaos execution across repeated iterations.
- Validated that completed logical history remains stable while hot state remains bounded or fully evicted.
- Validated that archived steps remain resolvable through the archive index and payload resolver.
- Validated retry metadata survives aggressive retention, eviction, and reconstruction.
- Validated repeated `GetStateAsync(...)` reloads remain deterministic after aggressive retention.
- Validated full test suite stability after distributed runtime-instance and retention reconstruction changes.

### Notes

- Implemented on branch `feature/distributed-runtime-instances`.
- Runtime execution can now operate in both single-instance and distributed multi-runtime-instance modes.
- `RunId` remains the controller/job lifecycle identifier.
- `ExecutionId` remains the durable runtime namespace for DAG records, state, snapshots, replay, payloads, and resolver indexes.
- Hot state is a bounded mutable execution window, not the authoritative long-term history.
- `CompletedSteps` is the durable logical completion history.
- Archive index and payload resolver are authoritative for evicted terminal step reconstruction.
- A terminal execution may have an empty hot state when retention has safely archived and evicted all terminal steps.
- Terminal lifecycle side effects must remain idempotent because multiple workers may observe terminal convergence concurrently.

  - tracing and worker metrics
- Added a custom `chaos.flaky-provider` step for integration testing retry behavior.
- Added resolver validation after terminal lifecycle to ensure completed required steps remain resolvable after retention, compaction, eviction, and finalization.
- Added terminal snapshot validation for background-controller executions.
- Added replay validation when the live execution still exists:
  - `ReplayAsync(...)` returns `AlreadyExists = true`
  - `Restored = false`
- Added restore-from-snapshot validation after deleting live DAG state:
  - terminal snapshot exists
  - live DAG record/state are deleted
  - replay restores from snapshot
  - `Restored = true`
  - `AlreadyExists = false`
  - restored record/state are available again from the DAG store
- Added deterministic replay validation:
  - captures execution fingerprint before deletion
  - deletes live DAG state
  - restores from snapshot
  - compares restored execution against original execution
  - validates deterministic consistency for:
    - `ExecutionId`
    - `PipelineName`
    - terminal status
    - completed steps
    - step statuses
    - retry counts
    - required resolved steps

### Changed

- Aligned batch DAG execution with retention-aware terminal lifecycle while preserving stable bounded batch behavior.
- Kept `AiDagBatchExecutionRunner` batch-safe instead of applying single-step retention semantics directly to each batch item.
- Preserved the stable batch execution flow:
  - claim batch
  - execute batch
  - persist step transitions
  - evaluate convergence
  - persist final record
  - snapshot / cleanup terminal execution
- Added batch-safe retention coordination support without breaking small or chaos runtime simulations.
- Updated background-controller replay tests to separate two replay contracts:
  - replay against existing execution
  - replay after live DAG state deletion
- Updated resolver validation to use the correct resolver contract:
  - `GetStepStatusAsync(...)` for status / dependency / convergence validation
  - `GetStepAsync(...)` when full step state, retry state, or payload-backed data is required
- Improved replay test structure so replay is validated through snapshot existence, runtime restore behavior, DAG store availability, and deterministic comparison.
- Improved terminal lifecycle snapshot handling by surfacing snapshot persistence failures instead of allowing silent timeout-only failures.
- Updated `AiDagExecutionLifecycleHelper` to normalize JSON-derived state before snapshot persistence.
- Updated snapshot persistence to normalize:
  - `AiExecutionState.PipelineConfig`
  - step config dictionaries
  - step result data dictionaries
- Converted `System.Text.Json.JsonElement` values into MongoDB-serializable .NET values before snapshot persistence.
- Updated `DefaultAiExecutionReplayService<TContext>` so distributed DAG replay restores into the authoritative `IAiDagExecutionStore` when available, instead of restoring only into the generic `IAiExecutionStore`.

### Fixed

- Fixed replay snapshot timeout caused by MongoDB failing to serialize `JsonElement` values inside `AiExecutionState.PipelineConfig`.
- Fixed hidden snapshot persistence failures by making snapshot errors visible during tests.
- Fixed replay restore behavior for distributed DAG executions where `ReplayAsync(...)` returned `Restored = true` but the restored execution was not available from `IAiDagExecutionStore`.
- Fixed replay contract mismatch by restoring distributed DAG snapshots into the DAG store.
- Fixed test ambiguity between controller `RunId` and runtime `ExecutionId`.
- Fixed background-controller tests so they validate runtime execution namespace correctly.
- Fixed retention / resolver validation assumptions by distinguishing hot-state access from archive-aware step status resolution.
- Fixed replay test design so `AlreadyExists` and `Restored` are validated as separate scenarios.
- Fixed deterministic replay coverage to prove replay restores the same terminal execution state rather than only returning a successful replay result.
- Fixed snapshot replay flow for DAG executions using JSON pipeline configuration values.

### Validated

- Verified small background-controller runtime simulation passes.
- Verified full chaos background-controller simulation passes.
- Verified completed required steps remain resolvable after terminal lifecycle.
- Verified replay returns `AlreadyExists = true` when the execution still exists.
- Verified replay restores from snapshot after live DAG state deletion.
- Verified deterministic replay produces the same execution fingerprint before and after restore.
- Verified retry counts survive snapshot replay.
- Verified completed step metadata remains stable across replay.
- Verified restored DAG executions are readable again through `IAiDagExecutionStore`.
- Verified snapshot persistence works with JSON-derived pipeline configuration.
- Verified `RunId` and `ExecutionId` remain strictly separated.

### Notes

- `RunId` is the controller/job lifecycle identifier.
- `ExecutionId` is the runtime execution namespace used by DAG state, records, snapshots, and replay.
- A replay result of `AlreadyExists = true` is valid when the execution still exists.
- A replay result of `Restored = true` is expected only after live execution record/state have been removed.
- Batch execution should not blindly reuse single-step distributed retention flow per step; batch execution needs batch-safe retention behavior.
- Snapshot persistence must normalize runtime state before writing to MongoDB because JSON pipeline definitions may introduce `JsonElement` values.
- In distributed DAG mode, replay must restore into `IAiDagExecutionStore`, because that is the authoritative execution store.

    Lua script handled orchestration

New flow:

    GetReadyStepsAsync
    ↓
    Resolve concurrency config
    ↓
    ConcurrencyGate.TryAcquireAsync
    ↓
    TryClaimStepAsync
    ↓
    Execute
    ↓
    Release concurrency slot

## Added

---

# Architecture Improvements

## Separation of Responsibilities

### RedisAiDagExecutionStore
Now responsible only for:

---

# Notes

## Current Runtime State

Distributed concurrency system is now ACTIVE:

- config-driven concurrency
- distributed concurrency gate
- lease-based throttling
- distributed-safe admission
- claim/release lifecycle

Policy-driven concurrency engine is NOT yet active:

- `DefaultAiConcurrencyEngine`
- `IAiConcurrencyEngine`
- `AiPolicyKind.Concurrency`

These remain reserved for future step-scoped policy evaluation once full pre-claim policy orchestration is introduced.

---

# Next Planned Step

## Concurrency Config Migration

Planned migration:

    AiParallelExecutionDefinition
    → deprecated

    AiConcurrencyDefinition.MaxDegreeOfParallelism
    → unified concurrency configuration

This will fully replace the old parallel execution configuration model with the new concurrency architecture.

## [1.0.4.4] - 2026-08-04 - DAG Execution Engine Refactor

## Overview

Refactored the DAG execution engine into focused runtime services to reduce engine complexity, isolate responsibilities, and improve maintainability while preserving deterministic execution behavior and full backward compatibility.

All existing tests are passing after the refactor.

---

# Architecture Refactor

## Previous State

The DAG engine previously centralized:

- local execution
- distributed orchestration
- batch orchestration
- retention coordination
- finalization logic
- cleanup lifecycle
- distributed claims
- step execution
- convergence persistence

inside a single large orchestration class.

This created:

- high coupling

---

# Result

## [1.0.3.4] - 2026-04-27

# 🚀 Test Stabilization — Hybrid Retention & Payload Metrics

## 🧠 Overview

This update stabilizes integration tests after introducing Hybrid retention
and multi-layer payload storage (Mongo + Redis cache).

The runtime behavior evolved from deterministic single-layer execution
to a realistic multi-layer system:

- state
- archive
- cache
- resolver

Tests have been updated accordingly.

---

## 🔥 Hybrid Retention — Production Validation

### Added full production-level tests

- ExecuteAllAsync_Should_Complete_With_Hybrid_Retention_And_Archived_Steps_Resolvable
- ExecuteAllAsync_Should_Remain_Idempotent_After_Hybrid_Retention

These tests validate:

- Engine-applied Hybrid retention (no manual invocation)
- Bounded hot execution state
- Proper eviction of completed steps
- Archive index population
- Resolver correctness (lazy + full load)
- Idempotent execution after retention

---

## ⚙️ Dependency Injection Fixes

- Registered missing retention policies:
  - CompactAiExecutionRetentionPolicy
  - EvictAiExecutionRetentionPolicy
  - HybridAiExecutionRetentionPolicy

- Fixed payload store provider resolution:
  - Prevented "inmemory" usage when RequireReplaySafePayloads = true
  - Enforced "mongo-redis" for replay-safe scenarios

---

## 📊 Payload Metrics — Test Stabilization

### Problem

Engine-level tests assumed deterministic metrics:

- Exact inline vs externalized counts
- Zero cache misses/fallbacks
- Strict byte comparisons

This is no longer valid due to:

- Retention compaction
- Resolver warm-up
- Redis cache behavior
- Multi-layer payload storage

---

### Fix

- Disabled StateRetention in payload metrics tests
- Replaced strict assertions with invariant-based checks:

  - InlineCount >= expected
  - ExternalizedCount >= expected
  - Bytes > 0

- Removed fragile assertions:
  - Cache write counts
  - Cache miss/fallback exact values

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Improvement

### Separation of concerns

- Compactor tests → exact payload metrics validation
- Engine tests → runtime invariants and behavior
- Retention tests → eviction and archive correctness
- Store tests → Redis/Mongo correctness

---

## 🔒 Safety Improvements

- Prevents false negatives caused by retention side-effects
- Ensures test expectations match real runtime behavior
- Avoids brittle tests in distributed / cached environments

---

## ⚡ Result

The test suite is now:

- Stable
- Production-aligned
- Multi-layer aware
- Resistant to future engine evolution

---

## 🧠 Summary

This update transitions the test suite from:

deterministic assumptions

to

production-realistic validation

ensuring long-term reliability of the runtime.

Added full archived step resolution via GetStepAsync.  
Added incremental warm behavior via WarmStepsAsync.  

Added resolver tests proving:  
- status lookup does not load full payload

## [1.0.1.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

#### Client Runtime & Testing

- Introduced multiple dispatch strategies for load testing:
  - Single burst execution
  - Maintained concurrency
  - Wave-based batching
- Improved burst request handling for high-volume authorization testing
- Enhanced logging granularity for request lifecycle analysis
- Added context key tracking across concurrent requests
- Enabled detailed visibility into request distribution patterns and concurrency behavior
- Added scenario launch capability for interactive testing of the client runtime
- Allows users to trigger predefined load scenarios directly from the UI
- Enables rapid validation of dispatch strategies and concurrency behavior
- Supports end-to-end testing of authorization flow, context rotation, and observability pipeline

---

#### Deterministic Realtime Observability Layer

Introduced a backend realtime observability layer designed to capture, process, and distribute runtime events without impacting the request hot path.

This layer establishes a foundation for deterministic, low-latency observability in distributed authorization systems.

##### Backend capabilities

- Runtime event dispatching pipeline for observability events
- Background worker responsible for consuming runtime events from a channel
- Reducer-based event processing outside of the request execution path
- Provider host abstraction enabling pluggable transport layers:
  - SignalR
  - WebSocket
- Null realtime provider for safe fallback / disabled mode
- Event context abstraction for runtime propagation
- Reducer dispatching model for specialized event handling and transformation

##### Background worker design

- Fully decoupled from request execution pipeline
- Guarantees zero impact on request latency (no blocking operations)
- Must never break host startup or shutdown flow
- Cancellation is treated as a normal lifecycle event
- Supports safe asynchronous fan-out of runtime events

##### Planned evolution

- Extraction into a standalone reusable observability module
- Potential cross-project reuse for other distributed systems

---

#### Realtime Logging System

- Added real-time log streaming using:
  - WebSocket
  - SignalR
- Added high-performance in-memory log sink for the client runtime
- Enabled real-time visualization of request lifecycle and context transitions

##### In-memory log sink characteristics

- O(1) push
- O(1) patch
- O(1) move-to-front on update
- O(1) trim
- Stable recency ordering (latest events always prioritized)

##### Internal design

- Map for id → node lookup (constant-time access)
- Doubly linked list for recency ordering
- Most recent item always at the head
- Optimized for high-frequency event ingestion

---

#### Visualization & UI

- Added key rotation graph visualization for real-time inspection of context transitions
- Introduced a new global UI for centralized monitoring of runtime activity

---

#### Context Storage & Redis Optimization

- Introduced Lua script preloading for Redis atomic operations
- Added SHA-based script execution after initial `SCRIPT LOAD`
- Eliminated repeated transmission of Lua payloads during context rotation
- Reduced overhead in high-frequency atomic Redis operations
- Improved efficiency of context rotation and synchronization mechanisms
- Significantly increased throughput under concurrent load conditions
- Internal benchmarks showed up to **500% performance improvement** over naïve per-request Lua execution

---

#### Adaptive Runtime Controls (Demo Mode)

Introduced a controlled runtime override layer allowing clients to modify selected runtime parameters via HTTP headers in **demo and testing environments**.

This enables precise experimentation with concurrency behavior and system limits without requiring backend redeployment.

##### Supported overrides

- Max in-flight concurrency:
  - `X-Demo-Max-InFlight`
- Rotation overlap window:
  - `X-Demo-Rotation-Overlap-Ms`

##### Capabilities

- Dynamic tuning of concurrency limits per context key
- Adjustable rotation overlap window for race condition and transition testing
- Configurable overflow policy (Reject strategy currently implemented)
- Custom HTTP status code for concurrency violations (default: 429)

##### Safety mechanisms

- Redis-backed in-flight counters with TTL protection
- Automatic expiration of abandoned counters (crash-safe behavior)
- Optional TTL refresh for long-running requests
- Security logging for concurrency violations (replay / misuse detection)

##### Performance optimization

- Optional Redis Lua script SHA caching
- Reduced network overhead
- Reduced execution overhead in concurrency control paths

##### Design intent

Designed for:

- Demo environments
- Load testing scenarios
- Concurrency experimentation

Ensures safe experimentation while preserving deterministic behavior in production environments.

---

### Improved

#### Authorization Runtime

- Improved stability of context rotation under concurrent load
- Improved consistency between Access Context resolution and rotation lifecycle
- Reduced race conditions during context rotation
- Improved determinism in concurrent execution scenarios

---

#### Client Console (Next.js)

- Improved request visualization and log readability
- Improved log rendering performance under high-frequency updates
- Better separation of log types:
  - HTTP logs
  - Realtime logs
  - Context rotation logs
- Enhanced debugging experience for authorization flows and concurrency scenarios

---

### Fixed

- Fixed inconsistent context key reuse after the initial request burst
- Fixed incorrect rotated keys in subsequent requests
- Fixed concurrency edge cases causing unexpected request rejection
- Fixed inconsistencies between client and server context synchronization

---

### Notes

This release significantly enhances the **observability, performance, and testability** of the Multiplexed RBAC system.

It introduces:

- A deterministic backend realtime observability pipeline
- A high-performance client-side logging and visualization system
- Advanced concurrency control mechanisms with runtime tuning capabilities
- Major Redis optimization strategies for high-throughput environments
