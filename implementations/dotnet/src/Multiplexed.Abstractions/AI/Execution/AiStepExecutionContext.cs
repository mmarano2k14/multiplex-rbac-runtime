    /// - Connects the global execution context to the selected step.
    /// - Exposes step identity and durable step state.
    /// - Provides access to execution services and cancellation.
    ///
    /// DESIGN:
    /// - This type is a lightweight context object.
    /// - It does not perform input/config/path resolution.
    /// - Step value resolution is handled by IAiStepContextHelper.
    /// - Path and payload resolution are handled by IAiContextValueResolver.
    /// - State mutation is routed through IAiExecutionStateWriter.
    ///
    /// IMPORTANT:
    /// - This context does not own orchestration decisions.
    /// - It is created after the runtime has selected a step to execute.
    /// - The selected step state is initialized during construction.
